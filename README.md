# Predict-Incident-Reporting---Python-Machine-Learning

Analyze and develop a machine learning model to predict school incidents across New York City boroughs.

• Identified 2 boroughs, and developed an optimal machine learning model with 83% accuracy of predicting incidents. 

• Utilized advanced modeling techniques such as VIF and RFE and built a robust model, and leveraged ETL process for real-time access to data on cloud. 

• Developed an optimal machine learning model utilizing Python and machine learning libraries - Pandas, Scikit-learn,SciPy, StatsModels, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

• Suggested and implemented mitigation plans that helped reduce high-risk incidents in NYC schools.
